<h3> Encryption </h3>

A program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher. Supposedly, Caesar (yes, that Caesar) used to “encrypt” (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) confidential messages by shifting each letter therein by some number of places. For instance, he might write A as B, B as C, C as D, …, and, wrapping around alphabetically, Z as A. And so, to say HELLO to someone, Caesar might write IFMMP. Upon receiving such messages from Caesar, recipients would have to “decrypt” them by shifting letters in the opposite direction by the same number of places.

<h3> Plurality </h3>
A simple program which determines the winner of a plurality election and prints the name(s) of the winner(s).

<h3> Runoff </h3>
A program that runs a runoff election. Runoff is a ranked choice voting system. It has the benefit to provide a winner that better reflect the voters’ preference. To make that work, each voter rank the candidates in a preference list. If any candidate has a majority of the first vote preference, that candidate is declared the winner. If no candidate has more than 50% of the votes, an instant runoff takes place.
